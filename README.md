# SimulatorProject
 Simulation from C++
 C++ generates data and stores it in covid.csv File
 App.py uses the covid.csv file with pandas and plots Graphs and It is then saved as new_plot.png
 using mpld3 we add interactivity and the image or the output is converted to HTML code and saved in index.html
 From main.html I have used iframe(convenient) to embed the graphs from index.html
 then used the bing widget to display the covid map.
